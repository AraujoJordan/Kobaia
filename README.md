# LaTest
**Not the first UI test library, but is easy to use**

LaTest is an Android library that provides an easy way to test UI with Kotlin.

```kotloin
uiDevice.apply {
    textClick("Skip", 2000)
    textClick("Get Started")
    textClick("Log In", 2000)

    byDescription("Enter your email").text = "test562@remitbee.com"
    byDescription("Enter your password").text = "Qwertyuiop"

    descriptionClick("Login Button")

    textClick("USE MY PASSWORD", 2500)
}
```

## ðŸš€ Why you should use LaTest?

1. Behaviour Driven Development testing
   * LaTest is an high-level test library that create tests readable as close to what the user are doing with the app. So you can focus yours UI tests in a generic user interaction approach.
2. No more wait for your UI
   * LaTest wait your UI be visible in the screen. Animations and networks requests doesn't need wait/sleep threads workarounds.
3. Interact with elements outside your app
   * Close the app and open notifications tray? Or even the apps drawer? It's an easy pie with LaTest.
4. Uses UiAutomator2.
   * Tests running Android 6/UiAutomator 2 are in average 20-30% faster then the same ones on Android 5.1/UiAutomator. ![Source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50131368 "Source")
