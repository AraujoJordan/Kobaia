Kobaia is an Android library that provides an easy way to test UI with Kotlin. Built on top of UIAutomator2, it provides a simple and discoverable API, removing most of the boilerplate and verbosity of common UIAutomator tasks.

```kotlin
@Test
fun testAppLogin() = uiDevice().apply {
    textClick("Skip", 2000)
    textClick("Get Started")
    textClick("Log In", 2000)

    byDescription("Enter your email").text = "test123@email.com"
    byDescription("Enter your password").text = "123456789"

    descriptionClick("Login Button")
}
```

## ðŸš€ Why you should use Kobaia?

1. Behaviour Driven Development testing
   * Kobaia is an high-level test library that create tests readable as close to what the user are doing with the app. So you can focus yours UI tests in a generic user interaction approach.
2. Automatic wait for your UI
   * Kobaia wait your UI be visible in the screen. Animations and networks requests doesn't need wait/sleep threads workarounds.
3. Interact with elements outside your app
   * Close the app and open notifications tray? Or even the apps drawer? It's an easy pie with Kobaia.
